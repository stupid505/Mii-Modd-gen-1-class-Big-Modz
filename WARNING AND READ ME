1. blooket is dooket cuz you can get banned from blooket for a month if you use Mii Modd. (side note: I GOT BANNED SO DON'T FEEL LEFT OUT!!!)
2. Stay safe and don't be too illegial with the mods Mii Modd has to offer.
3. if you are on a work account useing mii modd on blooket then switch accounts so that your main account dosent get banned.
4. Mii Modd V8 and over will have a note on some mods that says "prompt" those mods that say "prompt" have a chance of ruining gameplay by copying itseft and going back as like if you put it in. so if it says "prompt" then just don't click it...

       Just stay safe guys. mostly cuz i got banned on blooket thats the whole resoan i wrote this.
